 <h2>Dana Archer</h2>
 <p>Hi! My name is Dana!. I am a 20 year old Computer Science student. Some little facts about me: I love cats! I was homeschooled, and I like to bake :). </p>
 <p> As somewhat of an amateur artist, I always notice the artistic side of things, whether it be clothing design or unique website aesthetics. To me, web development feel like the middle ground between my artistic aspirations and coding background. I'm very excited to learn how to develop interesting websites!. </p>
